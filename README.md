# Google Street View Point Cloud Music Visualiser (alepaleptic)

This is a kind of buggy music visualiser that uses Google Street View point cloud data to visualise the music, and is basically a cross between a music visualiser example we made in class and this example: https://github.com/wearenocomputer/ofxGSVPointCloud from this tutorial: https://medium.com/@nocomputer/creating-point-clouds-with-google-street-view-185faad9d4ee.

This was made for the Generative Media Coding workshop by Nuno Correia at Aalto University.
